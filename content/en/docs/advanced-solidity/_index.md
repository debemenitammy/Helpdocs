Having mastered the fundamental building blocks of Solidity, you're now prepared to learn about the more advanced concepts for smart contract development. This section equips you with the tools and knowledge to build secure, and feature-rich smart contracts.

### What will you learn?

* The techniques for managing data within your contracts, including mappings for key-value storage and libraries for code reusability.
* Inheritance, a core object-oriented concept that allows contracts to inherit functionalities from other contracts.
* Understand advanced transaction concepts like modifiers, events, and error handling to enhance your smart contract's functionality and user experience.
* Grasp the concept of decentralization and interaction with external systems (oracles) to bring real-world data and functionalities into your smart contracts.
